# NLP Classification Project

### Author: Corey Solitaire, Angel Gomez

## Project Description: 
- Use web scraping to build, fit, and train a classification model to predict the primary language of a GitHub repository.  

## Project Goals:
1. Build a web scraper that extracts the contents of 100 GitHub repository README.md texts as well as the primary language of the repos.
2. Use this data to build a classification model to predict the primary langue of the repository
3. Develop a function that will take in the text of a README file, and use that data to predict the programming language.
